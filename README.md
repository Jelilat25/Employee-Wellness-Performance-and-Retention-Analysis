#### **Project Title:** Employee Wellness, Performance, and Retention Analysis





**Overview:**

This project aimed to explore the relationships between employee wellness usage, performance ratings, and retention within a corporate setting. By analyzing these relationships, the goal was to provide actionable insights that could help enhance employee well-being, productivity, and retention, particularly focusing on high-level employees such as Directors+.



**Objectives:**

1. **Correlation Analysis:** Understand the relationships between wellness usage, performance ratings, flight risk, and other variables.

2. **Hypothesis Testing:** Test specific hypotheses related to performance, flight risk, and gender differences in wellness usage.

3. **Predictive Modeling:** Build models to predict employee retention based on wellness usage and other factors.

4. **Survival Analysis:** Analyze the tenure of employees in relation to their wellness usage and performance ratings.



**Methodology:**

- **Data Collection and Preparation:** Collected and cleaned a comprehensive dataset comprising multiple Excel files with employee-related data.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Utilized descriptive statistics and visualizations to understand data distributions and relationships.

- **Statistical Analysis:** Performed correlation analysis, hypothesis testing (ANOVA, t-tests), regression analysis, and survival analysis to assess the relationships between wellness usage and other variables.

- **Visualization:** Created heatmaps and color-coded correlation tables to effectively communicate findings. Exported these visualizations to Excel for client use.



**Key Findings:**

1. **Performance and Wellness:** High-performing employees were found to have a statistically significant difference in wellness days used compared to low performers.

2. **Flight Risk:** Directors+ with higher flight risk tend to use more wellness days, indicating a potential area for targeted interventions.

3. **Gender Differences:** Gender-based analysis revealed significant differences in wellness days used, suggesting the need for gender-specific wellness programs.



**Tools and Technologies:**

- Python (pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, SciPy, statsmodels, lifelines)

- Jupyter Notebook

- Microsoft Excel



**Challenges and Solutions:**

- **Data Integration:** Managed multiple data sources with different structures, ensuring clean and merged datasets for analysis.

- **Handling Missing Data:** Implemented strategies to address missing values and categorical data issues to ensure robust statistical analysis.



**Impact:**

The insights from this analysis can help HR departments to:

- Design more effective wellness programs.

- Implement targeted interventions for high-risk employees.

- Enhance overall employee retention and performance.



**Conclusion:**

This project underscored the critical role of data-driven approaches in managing employee wellness and retention. By understanding the nuanced relationships between various HR metrics, organizations can foster a healthier, more productive workforce.
